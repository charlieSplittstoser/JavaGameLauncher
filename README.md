# JavaGameLauncher

This is a game launcher that I wrote for a friend's java based game. The game client is launched from a jar file. 

My launcher is designed to be a container for this client. It provides the user with a home/landing page which contains 
links to relevant web pages. It is responsible for checking for updates as well as providing automatic updates to the client. 

My goal is to convert this project to use Kotlin.
